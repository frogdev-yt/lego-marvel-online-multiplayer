- Source code is not very impressive, although figuring out that the sleep function has a minimum time of 16 ms was quite the upgrade
- Main hard part was reverse engineering
- Current version still only changing values and not calling functions

Future versions will include
- Character change sync
- Second player as separately created entity rather than the inbuilt co-op switch character
- Vehicle sync
- Health and attack sync
- In the far future, NPC sync for both players (or maybe a setting to remove NPCs altogether)

HOW TO USE:
- Launch the game and load into the map
- Run the exe file
- Choose either 1 for server host or 0 for client (host must run their exe before client can connect)
- Ensure the host has either port forwarded or has IP tunneling software - Default internal host port is 2069
- Input IP and port as prompted
